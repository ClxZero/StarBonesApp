# StarBonesApp
App made for NASA Space Apps Challenge

We made this app imagining we are making a publicity tool for a far future space travel company,
they have already developed methods of inter galactic travel at fractions of the speed of light that posses instant-acceleration and deceleration without harm to the body,
but most humans are not yet familiarized with the differences between the time dilation differences that such travels would generate,
so this travel agency needs to show some interest destinies and inform people about how much time will take them to get there, and how much time will pass on earth meanwhile.
